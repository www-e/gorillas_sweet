# Instagram Feed Implementation Guide

## Current Implementation

The website currently includes a placeholder Instagram feed implementation that uses existing dessert images as placeholders. This was implemented to:

1. Maintain the visual design of the social media section
2. Provide a structure that can be easily upgraded to a real Instagram feed
3. Demonstrate how the integration would work

## Upgrading to a Real Instagram Feed

To implement a real Instagram feed, you have several options:

### Option 1: Third-party Widget Services (Recommended)

This is the easiest and most reliable approach for GitHub Pages sites.

#### Steps:
1. Sign up for a service like [Lightwidget](https://lightwidget.com/), [Elfsight](https://elfsight.com/), or [SnapWidget](https://snapwidget.com/)
2. Connect your Instagram account to the service
3. Configure the widget appearance to match your site's design
4. Replace the placeholder implementation in `components/social.html` with the widget embed code

#### Example implementation with Lightwidget:
```html
<!-- Replace the instagram-feed-container div in components/social.html with this -->
<div class="lightwidget-widget">
  <iframe src="//lightwidget.com/widgets/YOUR_WIDGET_CODE.html" 
          scrolling="no" 
          allowtransparency="true" 
          class="lightwidget-iframe" 
          frameborder="0" 
          style="width: 100%; border: 0; overflow: hidden;"></iframe>
</div>
```

### Option 2: Instagram Basic Display API

This requires server-side processing, so it won't work directly with GitHub Pages without an additional backend service.

#### Steps:
1. Create a Facebook Developer account
2. Register your app and get API credentials
3. Implement a server-side proxy to handle authentication
4. Update the `InstagramFeed` class in `js/components/instagram-feed.js` to fetch from your proxy

### Option 3: RSS-based Solutions (Experimental)

Some third-party services convert Instagram feeds to RSS format.

#### Steps:
1. Find a service that converts Instagram to RSS (like inst-rss.appspot.com)
2. Update the `InstagramFeed` class to fetch and parse the RSS feed
3. Style the results to match the current design

## Files to Modify

1. `components/social.html` - Contains the Instagram section and feed container
2. `js/components/instagram-feed.js` - Contains the JavaScript implementation
3. `js/main.js` - Initializes the Instagram feed component

## Implementation Notes

- The current implementation uses a delay before loading to improve user experience
- The loading state and error handling are already implemented
- The visual design matches the existing site theme
- The component is accessible and responsive

## Next Steps

To implement a real Instagram feed:

1. Choose one of the options above
2. Follow the specific implementation steps for that option
3. Test thoroughly on different devices and browsers
4. Update this documentation with your implementation details
