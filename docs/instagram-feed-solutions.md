# Instagram Feed Solutions for Static Sites (GitHub Pages)

## Overview

Due to Instagram's API policy changes, particularly after Facebook's restrictions in 2020, displaying Instagram feeds on third-party websites without server-side processing has become increasingly challenging. Most legitimate solutions now require some form of authentication.

## Current Working Solutions

### 1. Official Instagram Embeds
- **Method**: Use Instagram's official embed code for individual posts
- **Requirements**: None (no API key needed)
- **Limitations**: 
  - Manual process for each post
  - No automated feed display
  - Doesn't show a dynamic feed of recent posts

### 2. RSS-based Solutions
- **Method**: Some third-party services convert Instagram feeds to RSS
- **Requirements**: External service dependency
- **Examples**:
  - inst-rss.appspot.com (unofficial, reliability may vary)
  - rss.app (commercial service)

### 3. Third-party Widget Services
- **Method**: Commercial services that handle Instagram API authentication
- **Requirements**: Account with the service provider
- **Examples**:
  - Lightwidget
  - Elfsight
  - SnapWidget
  - Tagembed

### 4. Client-side Libraries (Limited Options)
- Most client-side libraries that previously worked have been deprecated due to API changes
- Few options currently work without server-side processing

## Implementation Approaches for GitHub Pages

### Approach 1: Manual Embeds
```html
<!-- Instagram Embed Example -->
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/POST_ID/" data-instgrm-version="14">
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/POST_ID/">Post Description</a>
</blockquote>
<script async src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>
```

### Approach 2: Third-party Widget Integration
Most commercial services provide a simple script tag to embed:
```html
<script src="https://apps.elfsight.com/p/platform.js" defer></script>
<div class="elfsight-app-UNIQUE_ID"></div>
```

## Recommendations

1. **For simple needs**: Use Instagram's official embeds for specific posts
2. **For dynamic feeds**: Use a commercial service like Lightwidget or Elfsight
3. **For custom solutions**: Implement a server-side proxy that handles Instagram API authentication

## Important Considerations

- Instagram's API terms of service change frequently
- Solutions that work today may stop working due to policy changes
- Always check the terms of service of any third-party service used
- Some unofficial solutions may violate Instagram's terms of service

## Conclusion

For GitHub Pages sites, the most reliable solutions for displaying Instagram feeds are:
1. Official Instagram embeds (manual)
2. Commercial widget services (automated)
3. Server-side proxy solutions (custom development)

Client-side solutions without any form of authentication are largely unavailable due to Instagram's API restrictions.
